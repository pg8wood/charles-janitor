# Charles Janitor

> Launches and babysits Charles Proxy. Cleans up when Charles exits.

Charles Proxy is an extremely lucrative tool that sometimes forgets to [clean up after itself](https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/faqs/can-no-longer-browse-without-charles-running/), leaving your proxy settings mangled. `Charles Janitor` simply turns off web proxy and secure web proxy in your network settings when Charles closes.
